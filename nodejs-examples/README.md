# nodejs-examples

This directory contains examples of AI agents that integrate with AgentLabs thanks to the provided [node SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agentlabs/node-sdk).

Some of these examples are making use of the amazing [langchain](https://python.langchain.com) framework, while others are keeping things very bare bones.

All the node examples use Typescript.

## Start an example

Assuming you configured your environment properly (refer to this repository's top level README for more info on that), starting an example is only
a few steps away:

```sh
cd my-example

npm install
npm run start
```
