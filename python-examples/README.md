# python-examples

This directory contains examples of AI agents that integrate with AgentLabs thanks to the provided [python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/agentlabs-sdk/).

Some of these examples are making use of the amazing [langchain](https://python.langchain.com) framework, while others are keeping things very bare bones.

All the python projects used for these examples use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as their package manager.

## Start an example

Assuming you configured your environment properly (refer to this repository's top level README for more info on that), starting an example is only
a few steps away:

```sh
cd my-example

poetry install
poetry shell

py my-example/app.py
```
