# agent examples

This repository holds example agents that you could build and integrate with AgentLabs.

As of today we provide both `nodeJS` and `python` examples as these are the two languages supported by AgentLabs.

## Configure environment

If you want to try these examples out for yourself, using either your self hosted Agentlabs instance or the cloud version,
you will have to configure your environment beforehand.

For this, simply copy the contents of the `.env.example` file inside one named `.env`.

Fill the values according to your Agentlabs configuration, and you should be good to go.

The examples will automatically read this env file and use these credentials to connect.

To learn how to run an example agent, head over to the `python-examples` or `nodejs-examples` directory in which you'll find
more detailed instructions targeting your favorite programming language.
